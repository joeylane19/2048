PROJECT TITLE: 2048

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: For this project, I built a representation of the well-know iPhone and computer game, 2048 fully from scratch. The game is written in Java using Java's GUI libraries to create a nice interface for the player. The game features a grid of 16 spaces that can contain a block with a value of 2 raised to an integer power. The player may move the blocks left, right, down, or up, and when blocks with the same number collide, they merge and their values are added.

INSTRUCTIONS: Start by calling the main method of the Game class, and the game will begin. To move the blocks, click on the arrow keys in the top-right corner. The goal is to obtain a block with the value 2048. If you have filled the board and cannot move, you have lost.
